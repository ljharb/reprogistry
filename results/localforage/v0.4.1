([2d11c90]((https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/commit/2d11c90)))\n+* Avoid uncaught error in `dropInstance`. You can now catch errors thrown by `dropInstance`, see #807.\n \n-### [Version 0.3.0](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/0.3.0)\n+### [1.9.0](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/1.9.0)\n+\n+* Fixed TypeScript definition for `getItem`. It now notes that `getItem` can return `null`, so this change may cause TypeScript code that didn't account for `null` values to fail. See #980.\n+\n+### [1.8.1](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/1.8.1)\n+\n+* Reverted the ESM/`module` field change in #940, which broke many builds. See: #979. Sorry about that! 😓\n+\n+### [1.8.0](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/1.8.0)\n+\n+* No changes to code, but added a `module` field in `package.json` for better ESM support. See: #940.\n+\n+### [1.7.4](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/1.7.4)\n+\n+* Use `openKeyCursor` instead of `openCursor` for `key()` retrieval. Props to @MeMark2 for the fix, and thanks to @lincolnthree and @f for additional testing!\n+\n+### [1.7.3](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/1.7.3)\n+\n+* Add `.npmignore` file to reduce package size when installed via npm.\n+\n+### [1.6](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/1.6.0)\n+\n+* Add `dropInstance()` method to localforage.\n+* Improve IDB driver reliability when a connection gets closed.\n+\n+### [1.5.7]\n+\n+* Fix IE8 localStorage support detection.\n+\n+### [1.5.6]\n+\n+* Upgrade lie to 3.1.1 to work with yarn.\n+\n+### [1.5.5]\n+\n+* Roll back dropInstance breaking change.\n+\n+### [1.5.4]\n+\n+* Set `null` as `undefined` (for Edge).\n+\n+### [1.5.3]\n+\n+* Check whether localStorage is actually usable.\n+\n+### [1.5.2]\n+\n+* Prevent some unnecessary logs when calling `createInstance()`.\n+\n+### [1.5.1]\n+\n+* Try to re-establish IDB connection after an InvalidStateError.\n+* Added Generics to `iterate()` TS Typings.\n+* Define custom drivers syncronously when `_support` isn't a function.\n+* Use the custom driver API for internal drivers, which makes possible to override parts of their implementation.\n+\n+### [1.5](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/1.5.0)\n+* **Major storage engine change for Safari**: We now use IndexedDB as the storage engine for Safari v10.1 (and above). This means that **pre-existing Safari** `>= 10.1` users will experience \"data loss\" **after upgrading your site from a previous version of localForage to v1.5**. In fact no data is lost but the engine will change so localForage will seem empty.\n+  * You can use the [localForage 1.4 compatibility plugin](https://github.com/localForage/localForage-compatibility-1-4) after the upgrade so that all your Safari users (both old & new) continue to use the WebSQL driver.\n+  * Alternativelly you can force a connection to WebSQL using [localForage's config](https://localforage.github.io/localForage/#settings-api-setdriver) to either keep using your existing WebSQL database or migrate to IndexedDB.\n+\n+### [1.4.2](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/1.4.2)\n+* Fixes #562.\n+\n+### [1.4.1](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/1.4.1)\n+* Fixes #520; browserify builds work properly\n+\n+### [1.4](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/1.4.0)\n+* Fixes #516; this version should always load the correct driver without that bug.\n+\n+### [1.3](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/1.3.0)\n+* We now use ES6 for our source code and `webpack` to bundle the `dist/` files.\n+\n+### [1.2](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/1.2.0)\n+* Iterate through the entire database using `iterate()`. ([#283](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/pull/283); fixes [#186](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/pull/186))\n+\n+### [1.1](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/1.1.0)\n+* Custom drivers can be created using `defineDriver()`. ([#282](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/pull/282); fixes [#267](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/pull/267))\n+\n+### [1.0.3](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/1.0.3)\n+* `config()` accepts a new option: `driver`, so users can set the driver during config rather than using `setDriver()`. ([#273](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/pull/273); fixes [#168](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/pull/168))\n+\n+### [1.0](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/releases/tag/1.0.0)\n+\n+* It is no longer necessary to queue commands using `ready()` when using RequireJS. ([723cc94e06](https://github.com/mozilla/localForage/commit/723cc94e06af4f5ba4c53fa65524ccd5f6c4432e))\n+* `setDriver` now accepts an array of drivers to be used, in order of preference, instead of simply a string. The string option is still supported. (eg. now one can use `setDriver(['WebSQL', 'localStorage'])` instead of `setDriver('WebSQL')`)\n+* node-style, error-first argument method signatures are used for callbacks. Promises don't use error-first method signatures; instead they supply an error to the promise's `reject()` function.\n",
