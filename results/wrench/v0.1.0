I'm proud of what it's done; at the time of writing this, it was still downloaded over 25,000 times yesterday, and over 500,000 times in the last month. The fact that it wound up being embedded in so many projects is humbling and a great source of fun for me, but I just don't have the time to keep up with this at the moment. No alternate maintainers have appeared, and fs-extra is very well maintained anyway - one community solution is likely better.\n+\n+So long, and thanks for all the fish. The original docs remain available here for anyone who may need them. If I could 301 a GitHub repository I'd do so.\n+\n+Cheers,\n+- Ryan McGrath\n+\n+\n wrench.js - Recursive file operations in Node.js\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n While I love Node.js, I've found myself missing some functions. Things like\n-recursively deleting/chmodding a directory (or even deep copying a directory)\n-shouldn't need to be re-invented time and time again.\n+recursively deleting/chmodding a directory (or even deep copying a directory),\n+or even a basic line reader, shouldn't need to be re-invented time and time again.\n \n That said, here's my attempt at a re-usable solution, at least until something\n more formalized gets integrated into Node.js (*hint hint*). wrench.js is fairly simple\n to use - check out the documentation/examples below:\n \n-    var wrench = require(\"./wrench\");\n-    \n-    // Recursively delete the entire sub-tree of a directory, then kill the directory\n-    wrench.rmdirSyncRecursive(\"my_directory_name\");\n-    \n-    // Recursively chmod the entire sub-tree of a directory\n-    wrench.chmodSyncRecursive(\"my_directory_name\", 0755);\n-    \n-    // Deep-copy an existing directory\n-    wrench.copyDirSyncRecursive(\"directory_to_copy\", \"location_where_copy_should_end_up\");\n-\n-It should be noted that these are all currently synchronous operations. I'll be adding\n-asynchronous versions of chmod/copy in the near future, but rmdir is one that really can't\n-exist in an asynchronous fashion.\n+Possibly Breaking Change in v1.5.0\n+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n+In previous versions of Wrench, we went against the OS-default behavior of not\n+deleting a directory unless the operation is forced. In 1.5.0, this has been\n+changed to be the behavior people expect there to be - if you try to copy over\n+a directory that already exists, you'll get an Error returned or thrown stating\n+that you need to force it.\n+\n+Something like this will do the trick:\n+\n+``` javascript\n+wrench.copyDirSyncRecursive('directory_to_copy', 'location_where_copy_should_end_up', {\n+    forceDelete: true\n+});\n+```\n+\n+If you desire the older behavior of Wrench... hit up your package.json. If you\n+happen to find bugs in the 1.5.0 release please feel free to file them on the \n+GitHub issues tracker for this project, or send me a pull request and I'll get to\n+it as fast as I can. Thanks!\n+\n+**If this breaks enough projects I will consider rolling it back.
