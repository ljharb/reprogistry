No new features or fixes will be implemented.\n \n+## Follow [@npmjs](https://twitter.com/npmjs) on Twitter for updates.\n \n-## Installation\n+## About Node Security\n \n-Through npm:\n+Node Security helps you keep your node applications secure. With Node Security you can:\n+\n+* Make use of the CLI tool to help identify [known vulnerabilities](https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/) in your own projects.\n+* Get access to Node Security news and information from the ^lift team.\n+\n+## Installing the CLI (nsp)\n+\n+* To install the Node Security command line tool: `npm install -g nsp`\n+* Then run `nsp --help` to find out more.\n+\n+## Filter and threshold\n+\n+The results of the `check` command may be altered based on either a `filter` or `threshold`.\n+\n+- `--filter`: hide all vulnerabilities below the given CVSS score\n+- `--threshold`: display all vulnerabilities, but only exit with an error code if at least one finding has a CVSS score above the given value\n+\n+## Exit codes\n+\n+The CLI tool exits with the following codes to signify state\n+\n+- 0: command ran with success\n+- 1: command run was 'check', was successful, but returned vulnerabilities outside of the threshold or filter\n+- 2: command received a server error (5xx)\n+- 3: unknown error\n+- 4: there was an error in the output reporter\n+\n+## Output Reporters\n+\n+You can adjust how the client outputs findings by specifying one of the following built in reporters:\n+\n+- table\n+- summary\n+- json\n+- codeclimate\n+- minimal\n+\n+Example: `nsp check --reporter summary`\n+\n+Additionally, you can use [third-party reporter](https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=nsp+reporter). The packages of custom reporters must adhere to the naming scheme `nsp-reporter-<name>` and can then be referenced by that name:\n ```bash\n-npm i nsp -g\n+$ npm install -g nsp nsp-reporter-checkstyle\n+$ nsp check --reporter checkstyle\n ```\n+Please note that in case of naming conflicts built-in reporters (as listed above) take precedence. For instance, `nsp-reporter-json` would never be used since nsp ships with a `json` formatter.\n \n-Through GitHub:\n-```bash\n-git clone git@github.com:nodesecurity/nsp.git\n+### Creating a reporter\n+\n+A custom reporter should be a module named with the prefix `nsp-reporter-`, it must export two functions at minimum `error` and `success`.\n+\n+The `error` function accepts two arguments, `(err, args)` where `err` is an `Error` object representing the failure that occurred during whatever command may have been run, and `args` is an object representing all of the\n+command line arguments that were passed to the CLI at run time.\n+\n+The `success` function also accepts two arguments `(result, args)` where `args` is the same CLI arguments and `result` is an object with these three properties:\n+\n+- `message`: a string summary of the command's result\n+- `data`: the actual result of the command, the shape of this parameter varies for each command\n+- `meta`: detailed information from behind the scenes (response headers, etc)\n+\n+In addition to the top level `success` and `error` functions, specific handlers may be specified for each command that the CLI tool handles. For example\n+\n+```js\n+exports.error = function (err, args) {\n+  // run for all failures of any command\n+};\n+\n+exports.success = function (result, args) {\n+  // run for success of any command _except_ for 'check'\n+};\n+\n+exports.check = {};\n+exports.check.success = function (result, args) {\n+  // run for success of _only_ the 'check' command\n+};\n+```\n",
