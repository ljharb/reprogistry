Protractor runs tests against your application running in a real browser, interacting with it as a user would.\n+[Protractor](http://angular.github.io/protractor) is an end-to-end test framework for [Angular](http://angular.io/) and [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org) applications. Protractor is a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) program built on top of [WebDriverJS](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/WebDriverJs). Protractor runs tests against your application running in a real browser, interacting with it as a user would.\n \n-Protractor can be run as a standalone binary, or included into your tests as a library. Use [Protractor as a library](https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/docs/library-only.md) if you would like to manage WebDriver and your test setup yourself.\n+Compatibility\n+-------------\n \n-For more information, [read the docs](https://github.com/angular/protractor/tree/master/docs/getting-started.md), or head over to the [FAQ](https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/docs/faq.md).\n+Protractor 5 is compatible with nodejs v6 and newer.\n \n+Protractor works with AngularJS versions greater than 1.0.6/1.1.4, and is compatible with Angular applications. Note that for Angular apps, the `binding` and `model` locators are not supported. We recommend using `by.css`.\n \n-To run the sample tests\n------------------------\n \n-Install protractor with.\n+Getting Started\n+---------------\n+See the [Protractor Website](http://www.protractortest.org) for most documentation.\n \n-    npm install -g protractor\n+To get set up and running quickly:\n+ - Work through the [Tutorial](http://www.protractortest.org/#/tutorial)\n+ - See the [API](http://www.protractortest.org/#/api)\n \n-Start up a selenium server (See the appendix below for help with this). By default, the tests expect the selenium server to be running at `http://localhost:4444/wd/hub`.\n+Once you are familiar with the tutorial, you’re ready to move on. To modify your environment, see the Protractor Setup docs. To start writing tests, see the Protractor Tests docs.\n \n-The node module's example folder contains a simple test suite which runs against angularjs.org.

(Please do not ask support questions here on Github.)\n \n-    npm install -g protractor\n-    # Run the line below to see command line options\n-    protractor\n \n-You will need a *configuration file* containing setup info and *test files* containing the actual test scripts. The config file specifies how the runner should start webdriver, where your test files are, and global setup options. The test files use Jasmine framework by default ([read about using mocha instead](https://github.com/angular/protractor/tree/master/docs/using-mocha.md)).\n-\n-Create a configuration file - an example with detailed comments is shown in `node_modules/protractor/referenceConf.js`. Edit the configuration file to point to your test files.\n-\n-```javascript\n-// myConf.js\n-exports.config = {\n-  seleniumAddress: 'http://localhost:4444/wd/hub',\n-  specs: ['myTest.js', 'myTestFolder/*Test.js']\n-}\n-```\n-\n-The configuration file must specify a way to connection to webdriver. This can be\n- *   `seleniumAddress`: The address of a running selenium standalone server.\n- *   `seleniumServerJar`: The location of the selenium standalone .jar file on your machine. Protractor will use this to start up the selenium server.\n- *   `sauceUser` and `sauceKey`: The username and key for a [SauceLabs](http://www.saucelabs.com) account. Protractor will use this to run tests on SauceLabs.\n-\n-The runner exposes global variables `browser`, `by` and `element`. Check out [getting started docs](https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) to learn how to write a test.\n-\n-```javascript\n-// myTest.js\n-describe('angularjs homepage', function() {\n-  it('should greet the named user', function() {\n-    browser.get('http://www.angularjs.org');\n-\n-    element(by.model('yourName')).sendKeys('Julie');\n-\n-    var greeting = element(by.binding('yourName'));\n-\n-    expect(greeting.getText()).toEqual('Hello Julie!');\n-  });\n-});\n-```\n-\n-Run with\n-\n-    protractor myConf.js\n-\n-\n-Cloning and running Protractor's own tests\n-------------------------------------------\n-Clone the github repository.\n-\n-    git clone https://github.com/angular/protractor.git\n-    cd protractor\n-    npm install\n",
