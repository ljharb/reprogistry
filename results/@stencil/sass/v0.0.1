The plugin is for apps with build scripts already using a traditional webpack toolchain. However, webpack is not required to use web components built by Stencil since they are already lazy-load themselves on-demand, and use standardized ES Modules imports.\n+\n+Stencil combines the best concepts of the most popular front-end frameworks into a compile-time rather than a run-time tool. Stencil's output is just Web Components, so they work in any major framework or with no framework at all.\n+\n+\n+## Import Components\n+\n+First install the component library to be used, such as:\n \n ```\n-npm install @stencil/sass --save-dev\n+npm install @ionic/core\n ```\n \n-Next, within the project's `stencil.config.js` file, import the plugin and add it to the config's `plugins` config:\n+Next, import the component library within the app's entry file, such as:\n \n ```js\n-const sass = require('@stencil/sass');\n-\n-exports.config = {\n-  plugins: [\n-    sass()\n-  ]\n-};\n+import `@ionic/core`;\n ```\n \n-During development, this plugin will kick-in for `.scss` or `.sass` style urls, and precompile them to CSS.\n \n+### Updating `webpack.config.js`\n \n-## Options\n+Webpack will bundle the simple \"registry\" information of all the components into webpack's main bundle, but it does not include the actual component code. Instead the plugin copies external component assets to webpack's output directory, which allows for the web components to be lazy-loaded on-demand by the browser, and only pull down polyfills when required.\n \n-Sass options can be passed to the plugin within `stencil.config.js`, which are used directly by `node-sass`. Please reference [node-sass documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass) for all available options.\n+After installing the plugin, modify your `webpack.config.js` file as such:\n+\n+```\n+npm install --save-dev @stencil/webpack\n+```\n \n ```js\n-exports.config = {\n-  plugins: [\n-    sass({ includePaths: ['/my-include-path'] })\n+const stencil = require('@stencil/webpack');\n+\n+...\n+\n+  \"plugins\": [\n+    new stencil.StencilPlugin()\n   ]\n-};\n-```\n \n+```\n \n ## Related\n \n-* [node-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-sass)\n * [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/)\n * [Stencil Worldwide Slack](https://stencil-worldwide.slack.com)\n * [Ionic Components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ionic/core)\n@@ -47,4 +57,46 @@\n \n ## Contributing\n \n-Please see our [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for information on our rules of conduct.\n\\ No newline at end of file\n+Please see our [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) for information on our rules of conduct.\n+\n+### Creating an Issue\n+\n+* If you have a question about using this plugin, please ask on the [Stencil Worldwide Slack](https://stencil-worldwide.slack.com) group.\n+\n+* It is required that you clearly describe the steps necessary to reproduce the issue you are running into. Although we would love to help our users as much as possible, diagnosing issues without clear reproduction steps is extremely time-consuming and simply not sustainable.\n+\n+* The issue list of this repository is exclusively for bug reports and feature requests. Non-conforming issues will be closed immediately.\n+\n+* Issues with no clear steps to reproduce will not be triaged. If an issue is labeled with \"needs reply\" and receives no further replies from the author of the issue for more than 5 days, it will be closed.\n+\n+* If you think you have found a bug, or have a new feature idea, please start by making sure it hasn't already been [reported](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil-webpack/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue). You can search through existing issues to see if there is a similar one reported. Include closed issues as it may have been closed with a solution.\n+\n+* Next, [create a new issue](https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil-webpack/issues/new) that thoroughly explains the problem.
