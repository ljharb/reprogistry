By contrast, the GNU General Public\n-License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free\n-software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This\n-General Public License applies to most of the Free Software\n-Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to\n-using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by\n-the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to\n-your programs, too.\n-\n-  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not\n-price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you\n-have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for\n-this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it\n-if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it\n-in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.\n-\n-  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid\n-anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.\n-These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you\n-distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.\n-\n-  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether\n-gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that\n-you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the\n-source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their\n-rights.\n-\n-  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and\n-(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,\n-distribute and/or modify the software.\n-\n-  Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain\n-that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free\n-software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we\n-want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so\n-that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original\n-authors' reputations.\n-\n-  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software\n-patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free\n-program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the\n-program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any\n-patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.\n-\n-  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and\n-modification follow.\n-\n-        GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n-   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION\n-\n-  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains\n-a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed\n-under the terms of this General Public License.  The \"Program\", below,\n-refers to any such program or work, and a \"work based on the Program\"\n-means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:\n-that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,\n-either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another\n-language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in\n-the term \"modification\".)  Each licensee is addressed as \"you\".\n-\n-Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not\n-covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of\n-running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program\n-is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the\n-Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).\n-Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.\n-\n-  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's\n-source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you\n-conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate\n-copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the\n-notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;\n-and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License\n-along with the Program.\n-\n-You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and\n-you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.\n-\n-  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion\n-of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and\n-distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1\n",
