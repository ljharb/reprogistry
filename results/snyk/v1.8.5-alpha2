[Email us your feedback](mailto:support@snyk.io).\n+[Snyk](https://snyk.io/) is a developer-first, cloud-native security tool to scan and monitor your software development projects for security vulnerabilities. Snyk scans multiple content types for security issues:\n \n-## Installation & getting started\n+- [Snyk Open Source](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-with-snyk/snyk-open-source): Find and automatically fix open-source vulnerabilities\n+- [Snyk Code](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-with-snyk/snyk-code): Find and fix vulnerabilities in your application code in real time\n+- [Snyk Container](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-with-snyk/snyk-container): Find and fix vulnerabilities in container images and Kubernetes applications\n+- [Snyk IaC](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-with-snyk/snyk-iac): Find and fix insecure configurations in Terraform and Kubernetes code\n \n-Snyk is installed via npm. Run these commands to install it for local use:\n+[Learn more about what Snyk can do and sign up for a free account](https://snyk.io/).\n \n-```shell\n-npm install -g snyk\n-```\n+The Snyk CLI brings the functionality of Snyk into your development workflow. You can run the CLI locally from the command line or in an IDE. You can also run the CLI in your CI/CD pipeline. The following shows an example of Snyk CLI test command output.\n \n-Once installed, you can perform a quick test on a public package, for instance:\n+<figure><img src=\"../https://github.com/snyk/user-docs/raw/HEAD/docs/.gitbook/assets/snyk-cli-screenshot.png\" alt=\"\"><figcaption><p>Snyk CLI test command output example</p></figcaption></figure>\n \n-```shell\n-snyk test ionic@1.6.5\n-```\n+Snyk CLI scanning supports many languages and tools. For detailed information, see the following:\n \n-As you can see, Snyk found and reported several vulnerabilities in the package. For each issue found, Snyk provides the severity of the issue, a link to a detailed description, the path through which the vulnerable module got into your system, and guidance on how to fix the problem.\n+- [Supported languages, package managers, and frameworks](../../supported-languages/supported-languages-package-managers-and-frameworks.md) for Open Source and Snyk Code\n+- [Supported operating system distributions for Container](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-with-snyk/snyk-container/how-snyk-container-works/operating-system-distributions-supported-by-snyk-container)\n+- [Supported IaC Languages and cloud providers](https://docs.snyk.io/scan-with-snyk/snyk-iac/supported-iac-languages-cloud-providers-and-cloud-resources)\n \n-```text\n-$ snyk test\n-✗ Vulnerability found on gm@1.13.3\n-Info: https://dev.snyk.io/vuln/npm:gm:20151026\n-From: snyk-demo-app@latest > gm@1.13.3\n-Upgrade direct dependency gm@1.13.3 to gm@1.21.1\n-\n-✗ Vulnerability found on qs@0.6.6\n-Info: https://dev.snyk.io/vuln/npm:qs:20140806\n-From: snyk-demo-app@latest > webdriverio@2.4.5 > request@2.34.0 > qs@0.6.6\n-Upgrade direct dependency webdriverio@2.4.5 to webdriverio@3.0.1 (triggers upgrades to request@2.40.0 > qs@1.0.0)\n-\n-✗ Vulnerability found on qs@0.4.2\n-Info: https://dev.snyk.io/vuln/npm:qs:20140806-1\n-From: snyk-demo-app@latest > cucumber@0.3.0 > connect@2.3.2 > qs@0.4.2\n-No direct dependency upgrade can address this issue.\n-Run `snyk wizard` to explore remediation options\n-```\n+This page explains how to install, authenticate, and start scanning using the CLI. Snyk also has an onboarding wizard to guide you through these steps. For a demonstration, view [Starting with Snyk: an overview of the CLI onboarding flow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adj3VF82-v8).\n \n-In the next sections we'll explain how to run the same test on your own projects.\n+## Install the Snyk CLI and authenticate your machine\n \n-## Authentication\n+To use the CLI, you must install it and authenticate your machine. See [Install or update the Snyk CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/install-or-update-the-snyk-cli) and [Authenticate the CLI with your account](authenticate-to-use-the-cli.md). You can refer to the [release notes](https://github.com/snyk/cli/releases) for a summary of changes in each release. Before scanning your code, review the [Code execution warning for Snyk CLI](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/code-execution-warning-for-snyk-cli).\n \n-Some Snyk commands require authentication. We use GitHub for authentication, but **do not require access to your repositories**, only your email address. You can authenticate by browsing to the [Snyk website](https://snyk.io), clicking \"[Sign Up](https://app.snyk.io/auth/github)\", and pasting in the lines from your dashboard, which look roughly like this:\n+**Note:** Before you can use the CLI for Open Source scanning, you must install your package manager. The needed third-party tools, such as Gradle or Maven, must be in the `PATH`.\n \n-```shell\n-snyk auth <your key>\n-```\n+You can also install the CLI in your IDE or CI/CD environment. For details, see the [IDE and CI/CD documentation](https://docs.snyk.io/scm-ide-and-ci-cd-integrations) for instructions for each integration.\n \n-Alternatively, you can simply run `snyk auth` in your terminal and it'll guide you through this process. Once authenticated, you can proceed to run Snyk's [`wizard`](#wizard).\n+## Test your installation\n \n-## Wizard\n+After authenticating, you can test your installation. For a quick test, run `snyk --help`.\n \n-Snyk's `wizard` walks you through finding and fixing the known vulnerabilities in your project. It leverages the separate [`test`](#test), [`protect`](#protect) and [`monitor`](#monitor) actions, supported by an interactive workflow. To run the wizard, simply navigate to your project folder and run `snyk wizard` like so:\n+Alternatively, you can perform a quick test on a public npm package, for example `snyk test ionic`.\n \n-```shell\n-cd ~/projects/\n-snyk wizard\n-```\n-\n-The wizard goes through multiple phases.\n+Look at the `test` command report in your terminal. The report shows the vulnerabilities Snyk found in the package. For each issue found, Snyk reports the severity of the issue, provides a link to a detailed description, reports the path through which the vulnerable module got into your system, and provides guidance on how to fix the problem.\n \n-First, it takes stock of which dependencies are locally installed, queries the snyk service for related known vulnerabilities, and asks you how you want to address each vulnerability that was found. As you answer the questions, the wizard will create a Snyk policy file, stored in a file named `.snyk`, which will guide future Snyk commands.\n+## Scan your development Project\n \n-Here are the possible remediation steps for each vulnerability:\n+**Note:** Before using the Snyk CLI to test your Open Source Project for vulnerabilities, with limited exceptions, you must **build your Project**. For details, see [Open Source Projects that must be built before testing](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-cli/scan-and-maintain-projects-using-the-cli/snyk-cli-for-open-source/open-source-projects-that-must-be-built-before-testing-with-the-snyk-cli).\n \n-* **Upgrade** - if upgrading a direct dependency can fix the current vulnerability, the wizard can automatically modify your `package.json` file to use the newer version and run `npm update` to apply the changes.\n-* **Patch** - Sometimes there is no direct upgrade that can address the vulnerability, or there is one but you can't upgrade due to functional reasons (e.g. it's a major breaking change). For such cases, the wizard lets you patch the issue (using patches the Snyk team created and maintain). This option will make the minimal modifications to your locally installed module files to fix the vulnerability. It will also update the policy to patch this issue when running [`snyk protect`](#protect), as shown below.\n-* **Ignore** - If you believe this vulnerability is not exploitable, you can set the Snyk policy to ignore this vulnerability. By default, we will ignore the vulnerability for 30 days, to avoid easily hiding a true issue. If you want to ignore it permanently, you can manually edit the generated `.snyk` file. If neither a patch nor an upgrade are available, you can choose to ignore the issue for now, and we'll notify you when a new patch or upgrade is available.\n+In addition, depending on the language of your open-source Project, you may need to **set up your language environment** before using the Snyk CLI. For details, refer to [Supported languages, package managers, and frameworks](https://docs.snyk.io/supported-languages-package-managers-and-frameworks).\n",
