We've dropped support for Internet Explorer, removed legacy methods and polyfills, adopted modern standards like Pointer Events, and now publish Leaflet as an ESM module. The global `L` is no longer part of the core package (though it’s still available in the bundled version `leaflet-global.js` for backward compatibility).\n+\n+For more information checkout the blog post: https://leafletjs.com/2025/05/18/leaflet-2.0.0-alpha.html\n+\n+\n+### What's New in Leaflet 2.0\n+\n+- Targeting only **evergreen browsers**\n+- Switched from `Mouse` and `Touch` events to `PointerEvents`\n+- ESM support and tree shaking\n+- Rewritten using [standardized ES6 classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)\n+\n+\n+### Migration\n+\n+1. Replace all factory methods with constructor calls: `L.marker(latlng)` ➜ `new Marker(latlng)`\n+2. Change the `<script>` tag to `module`: `<script type='module'>`\n+3. Replace usage of `L` with explicit imports from the Leaflet package: `import { Marker } from 'leaflet'`\n+    - if you are not using a package manager like npm, you can use a `importmap`: https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/\n+4. To have global access to variables of a `module-script`, assign them to the `window` object (Not recommended): `window.map = map` \n+5. Consider [Leaflet V1 Polyfill](https://github.com/Falke-Design/Leaflet-V1-polyfill) if you are using outdated plugins\n+\n+\n+#### Old implementation\n+\n+```\n+<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.9.4/dist/leaflet.js\"></script>\n+<script>\n+\tconst map = L.map('map').setView([51.505, -0.09], 13);\n+\tconst tiles = L.tileLayer('https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {\n+\t\tmaxZoom: 19,\n+\t\tattribution: '&copy; <a href=\"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright\">OpenStreetMap</a>'\n+\t}).addTo(map);\n+</script>\n+```\n+\n+#### New implementation\n+\n+##### Module\n+\n+```\n+<script type=\"importmap\">\n+\t{\n+\t\t\"imports\": {\n+\t\t\t\"leaflet\": \"https://unpkg.com/leaflet@2.0.0-alpha/dist/leaflet.js\"\n+\t\t}\n+\t}\n+</script>\n+<script type=\"module\">\n+\timport L, {LeafletMap, TileLayer, Marker, Circle, Polygon, Popup} from 'leaflet';\n+\tconst map = new LeafletMap('map').setView([51.505, -0.09], 13);\n+\tconst tiles = new TileLayer('https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {\n+\t\tmaxZoom: 19,\n+\t\tattribution: '&copy; <a href=\"http://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright\">OpenStreetMap</a>'\n+\t}).addTo(map);\n+</script>\n+```\n+\n+##### Global Script\n+```\n+<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/leaflet@2.0.0-alpha/dist/leaflet-global.js\"></script>\n",

Just don't be silent.\r\n+\r\n+Ukrainians recommend the [Come Back Alive](https://savelife.in.ua/en/) charity.
