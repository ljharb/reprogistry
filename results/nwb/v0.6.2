Possibly even your first project?\n \n-```\n-npm install -g nwb\n-```\n+  Use [Vite](https://vite.dev/). There _will_ be a plugin and a project template for whatever you want to use.\n \n-## [Documentation](/docs/#table-of-contents)\n+- Have an old project which used something like nwb or create-react-app?\n \n-## Example Video\n+  Migrate to [Vite](https://vite.dev/). It's not going to be painless, but it's going to be better. I've done it. You can do it.\n \n-Just after nwb v0.6.0 was released, someone on [Reactiflux](http://www.reactiflux.com/) asked this question:\n+- Starting a new project which needs client rendering? Server rendering?\n \n-> hey guys, i need to prove a concept quickly, i need a boilerplate with react and some kind of mobile ui framework like ratchet, does anyone know of a good boilerplate like that?\n+  Use [Vite](https://vite.dev/). There's a plugin or maybe even a framework built on Vite for that. Don't take on more complexity than you need. Don't fight with a framework intended for server rendering if that's not what you need.\n \n-This video shows the resulting example of using nwb to create a new React project, installing [Ratchet](http://goratchet.com/) from npm and using its CSS, and [using the nwb config file to configure Babel](/docs/Configuration.md#babel-configuration) with a [plugin to make it more convenient to copy and paste HTML samples](https://github.com/insin/babel-plugin-react-html-attrs) from Ratchet's docs:\n+Thanks for using nwb!\n \n-[![nwb v0.6.0 example on YouTube](https://img.youtube.com/vi/jTuyiw-xzdo/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTuyiw-xzdo)\n+-- Jonny\n \n-## Quick Start Examples\n+---\n \n-Create a new React app and start a hot reloading development server:\n+# nwb\n \n-```\n-$ nwb new react-app github-issues\n-nwb: created /path/to/github-issues\n-nwb: installing dependencies\n-...\n-$ cd github-issues\n-$ nwb serve\n-nwb: serve-react-app\n-nwb: dev server listening at http://localhost:3000\n-...\n+![Linux](resources/linux.png) [![Travis][travis-badge]][travis]\n+![Windows](resources/windows.png) [![Appveyor][appveyor-badge]][appveyor]\n+[![npm package][npm-badge]][npm]\n+[![Coveralls][coveralls-badge]][coveralls]\n+\n+![nwb](resources/cover.jpg)\n+\n+nwb is a toolkit for:\n+\n+- [Quick Development with React, Inferno, Preact or vanilla JavaScript](#quick-development)\n+- Developing:\n+  - [React Apps](#react-apps)\n+  - [Preact Apps](#preact-apps)\n+  - [Inferno Apps](#inferno-apps)\n+  - [Vanilla JavaScript Apps](#vanilla-javascript-apps)\n",
