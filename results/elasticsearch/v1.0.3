It does not mean that the client automatically supports new features\n+of newer Elasticsearch versions; it is only possible after a release of a new\n+client version. For example, a 8.12 client version won't automatically support\n+the new features of the 8.13 version of Elasticsearch, the 8.13 client version\n+is required for that. Elasticsearch language clients are only backwards\n+compatible with default distributions and without guarantees made.\n+\n+| Elasticsearch Version | Elasticsearch-JS Branch |\n+| --------------------- | ----------------------- |\n+| main                  | main                    |\n+| 9.x                   | 9.x                     |\n+| 8.x                   | 8.x                     |\n+| 7.x                   | 7.x                     |\n+\n+## Usage\n+\n+- [Creating an index](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/getting-started-js.html#_creating_an_index)\n+- [Indexing a document](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/getting-started-js.html#_indexing_documents)\n+- [Getting documents](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/getting-started-js.html#_getting_documents)\n+- [Searching documents](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/getting-started-js.html#_searching_documents)\n+- [Updating documents](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/getting-started-js.html#_updating_documents)\n+- [Deleting documents](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/getting-started-js.html#_deleting_documents)\n+- [Deleting an index](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/getting-started-js.html#_deleting_an_index)\n+\n+### Node.js support\n+\n+NOTE: The minimum supported version of Node.js is `v20`.\n+\n+The client versioning follows the Elastic Stack versioning, this means that\n+major, minor, and patch releases are done following a precise schedule that\n+often does not coincide with the [Node.js release](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/) times.\n+\n+To avoid support insecure and unsupported versions of Node.js, the\n+client **will drop the support of EOL versions of Node.js between minor releases**.\n+Typically, as soon as a Node.js version goes into EOL, the client will continue\n+to support that version for at least another minor release. If you are using the client\n+with a version of Node.js that will be unsupported soon, you will see a warning\n+in your logs (the client will start logging the warning with two minors in advance).\n+\n+Unless you are **always** using a supported version of Node.js,\n+we recommend defining the client dependency in your\n+`package.json` with the `~` instead of `^`. In this way, you will lock the\n+dependency on the minor release and not the major. (for example, `~7.10.0` instead\n+of `^7.10.0`).\n+\n+| Node.js Version | Node.js EOL date | End of support      |\n",
