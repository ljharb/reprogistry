We also test against the latest changes in several branches in the Elasticsearch repository. To tell the client which version of Elastisearch you are using, and therefore the API it should provide, set the `apiVersion` config param. [More info](http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/configuration.html#config-options)\n+The Elasticsearch client is compatible with currently maintained JS versions.\n \n-## Examples\n+Language clients are forward compatible; meaning that clients support\n+communicating with greater or equal minor versions of Elasticsearch without\n+breaking. It does not mean that the client automatically supports new features\n+of newer Elasticsearch versions; it is only possible after a release of a new\n+client version. For example, a 8.12 client version won't automatically support\n+the new features of the 8.13 version of Elasticsearch, the 8.13 client version\n+is required for that. Elasticsearch language clients are only backwards\n+compatible with default distributions and without guarantees made.\n \n-Create a client instance\n-```js\n-var elasticsearch = require('elasticsearch');\n-var client = new elasticsearch.Client({\n-  host: 'localhost:9200',\n-  log: 'trace'\n-});\n-```\n+| Elasticsearch Version | Elasticsearch-JS Branch |\n+| --------------------- | ----------------------- |\n+| main                  | main                    |\n+| 9.x                   | 9.x                     |\n+| 8.x                   | 8.x                     |\n+| 7.x                   | 7.x                     |\n \n-Send a HEAD request to `/` and allow up to 1 second for it to complete.\n-```js\n-client.ping({\n-  // ping usually has a 3000ms timeout\n-  requestTimeout: 1000\n-}, function (error) {\n",
