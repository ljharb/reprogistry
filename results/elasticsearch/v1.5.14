See: http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/configuration.html#configuration\n-- Closing the client with `keepAlive` turned on will allow the process to exit. https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-js/issues/40\n-- Fixed a bug that caused invalid param/type errors to not be reported properly, in the browser builds that use promises.\n-- added the cat.threadPool to the master/1.0/1.x apis\n-- Enabled Basic auth in the Angular connector -- Thanks @jeff-french!\n-- Fixed a bug that was preventing index requests (and any other POST/PUT request) from using connections in the connection pool.\n-\n-## 1.4 (Jan 30 2014)\n-- The trace log messages will now diaplay the actual host connected to (without auth info) unless they are being written to a bash script\n-- API Updated with latest changes awaiting 1.0 release\n-\n-## 1.2/1.3 (Jan 17 2014)\n-- `apiVersion` config parameter was added. Use this to specify which API the client should provide, we currently offer support for elasticsearch branches \"0.90\", \"1.0\", and \"master\"\n-\n-\n-## 1.1 (Dec 22 2013)\n-- Changed the resolution value of promises. Instead of being an object like `{body: ..., status: ...}` it is now\n-  just the response body.\n-\n-\n-## 1.0 (Dec 17 2013)\n-- Initial Release\n-\n-\n-## pre 1.0\n-- Another module, now know as es on npm, used the elasticsearch module name. This module had several pre-1.0\n-  releases so we started at 1.0 to prevent collisions in exiting projects. The history for that project is available [here](https://github.com/ncb000gt/node-es)\n\\ No newline at end of file\n+Location: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/changelog-client.html\n",

We also test against the latest changes in the 0.90 and master branches of the Elasticsearch repository. To tell the client which version of Elastisearch you are using, and therefore the API it should provide, set the `apiVersion` config param. [More info](http://www.elasticsearch.org/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/javascript-api/current/configuration.html#_config_options)\n+Language clients are forward compatible; meaning that clients support\n+communicating with greater or equal minor versions of Elasticsearch without\n+breaking. It does not mean that the client automatically supports new features\n+of newer Elasticsearch versions; it is only possible after a release of a new\n+client version. For example, a 8.12 client version won't automatically support\n+the new features of the 8.13 version of Elasticsearch, the 8.13 client version\n+is required for that. Elasticsearch language clients are only backwards\n+compatible with default distributions and without guarantees made.\n \n-## Examples\n+| Elasticsearch Version | Elasticsearch-JS Branch |\n+| --------------------- | ----------------------- |\n+| main                  | main                    |\n+| 9.x                   | 9.x                     |\n+| 8.x                   | 8.x                     |\n+| 7.x                   | 7.x                     |\n \n-Create a client instance\n-```js\n-var elasticsearch = require('elasticsearch');\n-var client = new elasticsearch.Client({\n-  host: 'localhost:9200',\n-  log: 'trace'\n-});\n-```\n",
